# Bonus Task: Innovation Challenge Proposal

## Tool Name: **DocForgeAI**

### Problem:
Developers often neglect writing and updating software documentation. As codebases evolve, documentation becomes outdated, leading to knowledge silos and onboarding delays.

### Solution:
**DocForgeAI** is an AI tool that automatically generates and updates documentation by scanning source code, commit messages, and pull request discussions.

### How It Works:
1. **Code Parsing**: Parses functions, classes, and modules using static analysis.
2. **Intent Extraction**: Uses NLP to infer intent from function names, comments, and Git commit messages.
3. **Doc Generation**: Auto-generates docstrings, API references, and README snippets.
4. **Change Tracking**: Detects changes in code and flags documentation that needs updates.
5. **Customization**: Offers tone/style options (e.g., technical, beginner-friendly).

### Impact:
- Saves devs hours of manual documentation effort.
- Ensures consistent, up-to-date internal and external docs.
- Improves onboarding speed and code readability.

### Target Users:
- Dev teams using GitHub/GitLab
- Open-source contributors
- Agile environments with frequent code changes
