I used Selenium to automate login tests with both valid and invalid credentials. This ensures core authentication logic works reliably.

Manual testing is time-consuming and inconsistent; automation allows for faster, repeatable checks. AI-enhanced tools like Testim.io take it further by analyzing app behavior, adapting to UI changes, and auto-generating test cases. AI improves test coverage by detecting edge cases and dynamically adjusting to changing elements, which would break traditional Selenium tests. This blend of automation and AI boosts reliability in agile pipelines.
