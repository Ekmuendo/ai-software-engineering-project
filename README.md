# AI Software Engineering Project

## Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation and documentation for the AI for Software Engineering assignment. The project focuses on building intelligent software solutions through practical and theoretical tasks, including automated testing, predictive analysis, and natural language processing.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

- `part1_theory_analysis/`: Contains theoretical analyses comparing AI frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, and spaCy, as well as discussions on ethics and bias in AI.
- `part2_practical_implementation/`: Includes practical tasks such as:
  - Task 1: Decision Tree Classification on the Iris dataset.
  - Task 2: Automated Testing with Selenium.
  - Task 3: Predictive Analysis using Random Forest on the Breast Cancer dataset.
- `part3_ethics_optimization/`: Contains reflections on bias in AI models and code debugging exercises.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Libraries: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, spaCy, Selenium, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
